# Noddy Technical Documentation

This directory contains engineering documentation for contributors, security reviewers, and systems engineers working on Noddy. It covers the multi-crate Rust workspace, the Windows Qt 6 + `cxx-qt` desktop application, the Android Jetpack Compose + UniFFI client, the QUIC + TLS 1.3 protocol, the SQLite persistence layer, and the performance verification suite.

For end-user setup and feature guides, see [docs/guide/README.md](../guide/README.md).

## Contents

| Document | Scope |
|---|---|
| [Architecture](architecture.md) | Crate layout, runtime topology, discovery and transport (`Lan`, `Usb`, `Relay`), Android elevated helper, Windows Media Foundation virtual camera, and perceptual OKLab color engine |
| [Security Model](security-model.md) | Ed25519 device identity, OS key protection (Windows DPAPI tied to user account and Android Keystore AES-256-GCM), QR and 6-digit pairing protocols, `CapabilityMatrix`, consent gates, update checks, and localhost HTTP API isolation |
| [Protocol Overview](protocol-overview.md) | `noddy/0` wire framing (LEB128 + CBOR), QUIC stream taxonomy, control handshake, resumable BLAKE3 file transfers, real-time media framing, and index of the 18 specification files in [`docs/protocol/`](../protocol/v0.md) |
| [Storage and Retention](storage-and-retention.md) | SQLite schema v8 (`core/noddy-core/src/store.rs`), timeline and `MessagingStyle` conversation caches, persistent FIFO send queue (`send_queue`), and `KeyProtector`-encrypted clipboard history |
| [Performance Budgets](performance-budgets.md) | Startup, memory, CPU, transport, and latency targets from [`docs/PERFORMANCE.md`](../PERFORMANCE.md), measured benchmarks, and key root-cause engineering optimizations |
| [Building and Testing](building-and-testing.md) | Pinned toolchains (`Rust 1.97+`, `Qt 6.12`, `Android compileSdk 37 / minSdk 26`, `JDK 17+`), `cargo xtask` automation, PowerShell verification scripts, and test suites |
| [Releasing](releasing.md) | Versioning, the tag-driven release workflow, Android and Windows signing, and how both apps update themselves |
| [Contributing](contributing.md) | Coding conventions, licensing (`MPL-2.0`, `GPL-3.0-or-later`, `CC BY 4.0`), module header policy, protocol evolution rules, and pre-submission checks |
